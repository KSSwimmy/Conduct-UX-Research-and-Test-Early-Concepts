### Reading - Learn more about usability studies

As a UX designer, your job is to learn as much as you can about the users you’re designing for, in order to create a helpful product that meets the users’ real needs. One way to gather feedback about your work directly from your target users is by conducting a **usability study**. As a reminder, a usability study is a research method that assesses how easy it is for participants to complete core tasks in a design. You might also hear this research method referred to as usability testing; both are accepted terminology.

Usability studies can help your team understand how real users interact with your designs and how well your product meets their needs. Because usability studies can be relatively inexpensive, they’re a “low risk, high reward” way to test designs! 

There are two types of usability studies that you can conduct: moderated and unmoderated. 

**Moderated usability studies** have a person, known as a moderator, guide participants through the study in real time. Because a person facilitates the session, moderated usability studies allow for rapport building between the moderator and participant, which can help the participant open up and share more feedback about the design. Moderated studies work best when you want to dig into the details because you can ask follow-up questions throughout the session to learn more.

**Unmoderated usability studies** have participants test the prototypes without human guidance. Participants move through the study at their own pace and often in their own environment. Usually, the study is recorded on video, and the UX team reviews the video footage after the study. Unmoderated studies can be advantageous because they more closely simulate how a user would interact with the product in the real world.

Whether you conduct a moderated or an unmoderated usability study, a few things will remain the same:

- **Tasks** in a usability study are actions a real user might perform in your product, like entering an address, placing an order, or making a reservation. The tasks that you ask participants to complete during the usability study should be the same tasks that an actual user would need to complete to successfully move through your product in the real world. 
- **The script** should be repeated with each participant, in the same order, to replicate the same study environment. Consistency is key here.
- **Participants** should be representative of the product’s target users and should align with the personas you created earlier in the design process. In other words, participants in the research study should have the traits you’ve already matched with users of your product. 

Usability studies can and should be conducted at every stage of the UX design process. Of course, the number of studies you conduct depends on your project’s timeline, goals, and budget. But usability studies can happen when you have a low fidelity prototype, a high fidelity prototype, or even a finished product.

### Reading: Explore the advantages and disadvantages of usability studies

Now that you know the basics of moderated and unmoderated usability studies, let’s dig into the details and explore the benefits and limitations of each type of study. 

Remember, **moderated usability studies** have a person, known as a moderator, guide participants through the study in real time. Let’s begin by exploring some **advantages** of conducting a moderated usability study.

- **Build rapport.** Moderated usability studies allow for rapport building between the moderator and participant, which can help the participant open up and share more feedback about the design. Building rapport is especially important if the design being tested deals with sensitive or personal issues. In addition, speaking live can make it easier for the researcher to understand the users’ backgrounds and empathize with their needs. 
- **Observe firsthand.** Feedback and learnings can be more impactful when you see participants interacting with your prototype or product firsthand, instead of watching a recording or reading about the results. You can also bring in stakeholders to observe the study, either remotely or in an observation room, to get the same high-touch interaction with real users.  
- **Provide live guidance.** The moderator guides each participant through the study live, which helps to ensure that participants complete the exact tasks that you want to get feedback about.
- **Explain the user journey.** The moderated setting gives you more time and opportunity to test ambiguous or complex problems with your product that could be misinterpreted if there wasn’t guidance. This is why moderated usability studies are often used early in the design process, when low-fidelity prototypes might be unclear to users. 
- **Control the conversation.** A moderator keeps the flow of the session from being interrupted and helps participants stay focused, which makes the study more productive overall.
- **Make language adjustments.** The moderator can rephrase a prompt or question that a participant is not understanding. This is beneficial because it allows you to collect more information that you can act on to improve your design. 
- **Gain clarification.** The moderator can ask participants to clarify the feedback they’re providing or to elaborate further (e.g., “tell me more about that”), which can lead to richer insights.

With all of these benefits in mind, it might seem like moderated usability studies are the way to go! However, it’s important to note that moderated usability studies have some disadvantages too.

- **Influence or bias.** Because a person is guiding the study, there’s a chance that the moderator can accidentally let their own thoughts or feelings influence the way that they ask questions or in the body language they show, which can affect the study's results.
- **Self-identification.** If participants do not connect or identify with the moderator, they might have a hard time being open about their experience using the product, especially if the subject matter is personal or sensitive.
Participant pool. Since a human moderates each session live, most moderated usability studies happen during standard working hours. Some populations are hard to reach during standard working hours, and therefore could be underrepresented in your study findings. 
- **Difficult scheduling.** Because you are coordinating two people’s schedules (the moderator and the participant), it can be difficult to schedule moderated usability studies, and it can be hard to reschedule a participant who cancels or fails to show up.
- **Reliable internet required.** Internet connectivity issues for remote moderated sessions can throw off the tempo of the session, can make it harder for participants to communicate effectively, and can even cause the session to end early in some cases. 
- **High cost.** Moderated usability studies are comparatively expensive because someone needs to spend time serving as the moderator for each individual session and because there is often a cost to rent space to host sessions in person.

Alternatively, **unmoderated usability studies** have participants test the prototypes without human guidance. An unmoderated study can be done by recording a participant’s screen or having the participant give feedback on tasks. Since there’s nobody to assist, it’s super important that your designs are clear and accessible to all users. 

Let’s start with some **advantages** of conducting an unmoderated usability study.

- **Natural product interactions**. Because users are mostly unsupervised while completing tasks in the product, they’re more likely to use the product naturally and intuitively. This can lead to a more accurate understanding of the user’s experience in the real world.  
- **More participants.** Unmoderated studies make it easier to include more participants because you don’t need to spend time guiding each participant live. You can also recruit participants in different time zones and with different availability, like outside of standard working hours. Keep in mind that you want to have a minimum of five participants, which is a large enough sample size to gain valuable feedback, and a maximum of eight participants, since there is often diminishing return on investment if additional participants are added to the study.
- **Easier scheduling.** Unmoderated usability studies allow participants to complete tasks on their own time and in their own space because there is no need for a moderator. If a participant does not show up or needs to reschedule the session, it's easier to do so when it's unmoderated, since the participant can do it on their own time.
**Inexpensive.** Unmoderated studies are more cost-effective than moderated studies, since they don’t require a facilitator or physical location to conduct the study.
- **More privacy.** If the product involves sensitive or personal topics, an unmoderated setting can make participants feel more comfortable answering honestly and sharing their perspective, since they aren’t required to speak with someone face-to-face. 
- **Simple user journeys.** Unmoderated usability studies work well to test straightforward user journeys and simple features of a product, since participants don’t need a lot of guidance to complete tasks. 

Of course, unmoderated usability studies have some disadvantages too.

- **No real-time support.** If participants don’t understand the wording of the prompt or if they have technical difficulties, there is usually no one to provide support. 
- **No live follow-ups.** Unmoderated usability studies don’t give the UX team an opportunity to ask participants real-time follow-up questions or to clarify their feedback. This can be limiting if the participant does not explain their problem in detail because there is no way to follow up while the UX team watches the recording of the session later.
- **Potential distractions.** There is little to no control over the environment to ensure you have the participant’s full attention. Without a moderator present, participants could multitask and not be focused on the key activities in the study.
- **Possible privacy breaches.** To test the use of your product in an unmoderated study, you might need to upload your designs to a testing platform, which participants access from their homes. This means there is less control over your intellectual property. 
- **Inaccessibility.** The testing platform you use to conduct remote research might not be equally accessible to users with disabilities or people who use assistive technology.
- **More data to analyze.** Because there is no moderator to control the conversation of the session, the information you collect might be off topic or irrelevant to your research. 
- **Simple user journeys only.** Unmoderated studies are not great for testing complex user journeys because if a user gets stuck with a complex prototype, there’s no one to guide them through the process. 

#### Start testing
When you’re choosing whether to conduct a moderated or an unmoderated usability study, there are a lot of things to consider! Both can help you get the research data you need to improve your product; it’s just a matter of deciding which one will do it better. Keeping these advantages and disadvantages in mind can help you make the right choice for your specific project and research goals.

### Reading: Learn more about usability study best practices

A usability study is at its best when participants come from diverse backgrounds and have varying abilities. The unique life experiences, perspectives, identities, and abilities of participants will inform the feedback they provide about your designs. Your goal is to create designs that work for all types of users, so learning from a diverse pool of research participants is key. Before you conduct your first usability study, keep these five best practices in mind: get comfortable, put people first, don’t skip the paperwork, communicate clearly, and ask the right questions. 

Participants in a usability study provide the best feedback when they feel comfortable with the moderator, which could be you or one of your team members. Starting with **getting-to-know-you small talk** can make it easier for participants to feel comfortable and open up, both in person and virtually. You want to establish a professional-but-friendly rapport with participants right from the start. Here are some good questions to kickstart the conversation:

- How is your day going?
- Did you have an easy time getting here (or signing on)?
- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? 
- Do you have any favorite hobbies?

These questions help participants start to engage with the moderator, which can make sharing their perspectives about the product more natural, too. Remember to tailor the ice-breaker questions to the types of participants in your study. For example, if your study participants are minors or children, you might want to add an engaging and entertaining activity to begin the study.

Then, **thank participants for coming.** Communicate how grateful you are that the participant is taking the time to participate in the study.  

It’s also helpful to remind participants that they should be **open and honest** about their experience, so the design team can make improvements. To get the most useful feedback about the product you’ve designed, let participants know that you’re here to find out how to improve the design, so constructive criticism is more than welcome.

Finally, make sure the **space** you’re conducting the study in is physically comfortable. Usability studies can take place in a usability lab, inside someone's home, in a public area, or online. Each one requires a different setup to ensure participants are feeling at ease and properly accommodated. 

- A **usability lab** is a place with equipment for conducting a usability study, like screen recorders, eye-tracking devices, and computers or mobile devices set up specifically for testing. 
- If you’re conducting the usability study in someone’s home or in a public area, find a place that's as clear of distractions as possible. 
- For usability studies conducted online, communicate whether you’re recording the participants or their screens, and let them know that the recordings will only be used for research related to your test.

Throughout a usability study, you want to use participants’ preferred pronouns and identifiers (like he, she, or they), pronounce their names correctly, use the correct courtesy titles (like Mr., Ms., Mrs., Captain, or Dr.), and ask whether they have any other communication preferences. Giving participants the chance to tell you how they want to be addressed puts the person first. In addition, this helps you get in the right mindset of what a usability study is all about: how people interact with technology. 

When engaging with participants who use an interpreter, always address your comments and questions directly to the participant, instead of to the interpreter. Looking at the participant and speaking directly to them is the best way to make sure you understand how the participant is experiencing your product. 

When engaging with participants of different backgrounds and abilities, **use people-first language**. Literally! Put “people” or “person” first in your phrasing. For example, you should say “person with a disability” instead of “disabled person.”

Keep in mind: Marginalized communities are often not included in research studies, which means designs often don't address their specific needs. Remember, **marginalized communities** are ones where people have specific characteristics and life experiences that prevent them from fitting into what society inaccurately defines as “normal”. Because of this, the experiences of users from marginalized communities are sometimes not considered in the research planning of UX designers.

The definition of which people fit into a marginalized community changes depending on the context. For example, when designing a tool like a kitchen gadget, you may want to consider if the design supports users who are left-handed. Including their perspectives and unique pain points in your research would help generate new insights. It's important to formally commit to diversifying your group of study participants. Your product will benefit too! Incorporating feedback from marginalized communities in your designs will inevitably yield better insights. 

Once you’ve made participants comfortable and started getting to know them, you need to take care of some paperwork. Ask participants to sign a **nondisclosure agreement** (NDA), which informs participants that they can’t talk about your product or the usability study publicly. If the NDA is set up correctly, it helps build trust with participants and increase rapport. You should keep this document in your records because it protects confidentiality and your intellectual property. If your study participants are minors, their parents must consent to the child’s involvement in the study. 

Participants also need to sign paperwork to **allow their session to be recorded.** You might record a usability study session through a paper note sheet, screen recorder, video recorder, or audio recorder. Recording sessions makes it easier to turn observations into insights later, but participants will need to be aware of this process and provide consent.

Now, with all of the logistics taken care of, you’re ready to begin the study. **Explain the focus of the study** and what participants will give feedback on. Give the participant a roadmap or preview of what’s to come during the session. Be sure to ask the participant if the study you’ve explained will be okay with them before proceeding. 

You’ll want to introduce the **think-aloud method**, which is a type of data gathering that has participants turn their internal thoughts into shared ideas through spoken, signed, or typed words. When you use the think-aloud method, participants explain what they’re doing while they’re completing tasks. This gives you, as the researcher, an opportunity to record exactly what participants are thinking about a product, in addition to what you observe them doing during the study. With this method, it’s crucial that participants know that they can be honest; they can’t offend you because their observations are helpful to improving the designs. 

Also, **remind participants that they are not being tested.** The goal is to understand how the user is experiencing your product, so there’s no right or wrong answer! If the participant can’t complete a task, that isn’t a reflection of their personal abilities; it’s a reflection of the design’s usability.

If you’re ever unsure about the feedback participants are sharing, try to **summarize their ideas for confirmation.** Repeat back what you think the participant means, and encourage them to correct or confirm the statement.

When it comes to usability studies, the questions you ask and the ways you ask them directly impact the insights you uncover. Sometimes the best nuggets of information come from a participant building on a point or clarifying themselves, rather than directly answering one of your questions. Here are a few pro tips to help you ask the right questions during a usability study:

- **Use the same set of questions with each participant.** Usability studies typically focus on one person at a time, so you want your conversations with each user to be about the same design features. Keep your research consistent.
- **Ask open-ended questions.** Avoid asking “yes” or “no” questions. Instead, ask questions that start with “why.” This will allow for more detailed feedback and might reveal useful information you can later include in your product.
- **Encourage elaboration.** Sometimes, the script of questions you pre-wrote while planning the study isn’t thorough enough. Ask follow-up questions if you need to dig deeper. Maybe something unexpected came up and you want to explore it, or you didn’t get enough information from a participant’s first response and need them to elaborate. If you’re unsure how to ask a follow-up question, the phrase “tell me more about that” usually works. 
- **Ask the same question from different angles.** Interviews can be awkward, so it might take awhile before you find out what participants really think. You can prepare for this delay by asking the same question from multiple angles. For example, you might ask, “How often do you go to the grocery store?” at the start of the interview; then, “How many times per week do you go to the grocery store” in the middle of the interview. The participant might give you a more detailed answer the second time around, which can help you get more accurate insights and useful data.
- **Don’t mention other participants.** Talking about other participants can lead to privacy violations and skew the answers of the participant you’re with, which leads to inaccurate data.
**Don’t ask leading questions.** Be careful about how you word each question. Participants can pick up on your preconceived notions if your questions are worded in a biased way. For example, if you ask, “Why do you think apples are more popular than pears?” then the participant is primed to answer positively about apples and negatively about pears. Instead, try asking a more neutral, open-ended question, like: “Do you prefer apples or pears, and why?” 

#### You're ready to get started! 

Keeping these best practices in mind will put you well on your way to conducting your first moderated usability study. By helping participants feel comfortable, putting people first, double checking all of the paperwork, communicating clearly, and asking the right questions, you’ll set yourself up to have a high-quality study that leads to lots of insights. You’re ready to discover how people experience the product you’ve designed!

### Identify biases when interviewing usability study participants

Identify a method you can use to reduce the possibility of social desirability bias during the interview process.

- Ask participants which statements they most relate to


**Serial position effect** is a psychological bias that states that when given a list of items, people are more likely to remember the first few and the last few, while the items in the middle tend to blur.

**Friendliness bias** describes the tendency of people to agree with those they like in order to maintain a non-confrontational conversation.

The last bias moderators need to guard against is the **social desirability bias**, which describes the tendency for people to answer questions in a way that will be viewed favorably by others.

### Reduce bias in interviews

How to reduce bias when conducting usability studies 
- Identify and admit your own biases 
- Find participants from a representative sample 
- Define the research criteria beforehand 
- Phrase interview questions thoughtfully 
- Let participants express themselves fully and in their own words
- Be mindful of your body language

### Learn more about reducing bias in interviews

Being fully unbiased when conducting and observing interviews is impossible. Everyone has their own set of biases that they bring to every interaction. Acknowledging your own personal biases so that you can move beyond them is key when conducting research, like interviews. Why? Well, you need to gain accurate feedback about how users really think and feel. Remember, your goal as a UX designer is to put the user front-and-center always, which means you need to learn about their honest and authentic perspectives in order to best create designs that meet their needs. 

Check out five common types of bias that might come up when conducting UX research and some tips for how to overcome those biases. 

**Confirmation bias** is the tendency to focus on information that matches a pre-existing belief. Have you ever tried to find evidence to prove a hypothesis that you already have? If so, that’s confirmation bias in action! Your personal preferences can sneak their way into your research, too, so here are a couple of pro-tips to help you combat this bias when conducting research. 

- **Recruit an appropriate sample size.** In the real world, many UX researchers want to have five to eight participants when conducting a usability study. Research shows that five participants is a large enough sample size to gain valuable feedback, and there is often diminishing return on investment if more than eight participants are added to the study. This means that you typically learn what you need to know about the usability of designs by interviewing five to eight participants. Interviewing the right number of participants and gathering a variety of perspectives will help reduce confirmation bias.

- **It’s not about your beliefs.** Pay attention to and embrace findings that challenge your hypotheses. If participants share ideas that contradict your assumptions, it could highlight the need to dig into an issue more deeply and can pave the way for new learnings to emerge.

- **Leading questions** are research questions that are intentionally framed to guide participants to respond in a certain way. Consider this example: How might participants answer differently when asked the question, “How did you locate the product you wanted to buy?” compared to “Is having the product you wanted to buy under the blue tab easy to find?” The first question is open-ended and encourages interview participants to share their own process and thoughts. The second question is a leading question that steers the participant toward supporting the design choice of a blue tab. 

To avoid leading questions in your own research, try these pro-tips:

- **Encourage participants to think aloud.** Ask interviewees to share all of their thoughts as they review a product. This will help ensure that the information collected comes from the participant’s actual experience with the product, not the experience that researchers want them to have. After each interview question or task, pause to provide participants extra time to share additional thoughts.

- **Limit your responses.** When you are conducting research, try not to offer your own opinions, like, “Yes! That’s true. I totally agree.” This type of feedback can shape participants' responses because participants are likely to want to receive more validating feedback. If participants are trying to please the researcher, it can lead to an inaccurate representation of their real wants and needs.

**Friendliness bias** describes the tendency of people to agree with those they like in order to maintain a non-confrontational conversation. In other words, participants might share what they think you want to hear! In addition, being agreeable makes the interview go faster and easier. That’s why the friendliness bias is sometimes called “the principle of least effort” because people have a tendency to avoid resistance when completing tasks.

How can you overcome the friendliness bias when conducting interviews? Check out these pro-tips:

**Honesty is the best policy.** Before the research study begins, make it very clear to participants that they need to be honest and that their responses won’t hurt your feelings.
**Stay consistently engaged.** As a researcher, you should show curiosity and practice active listening in the same way throughout the entire interview, no matter how positive or negative the feedback that participants share. 

**Social desirability bias** describes the tendency for people to answer questions in a way that will be viewed favorably by others. This type of bias can occur when research participants provide answers that are rooted in what they think is popular, instead of what they actually believe. In other words, social desirability can cause participants to focus on the positive aspects of their experience with the product and minimize the negative aspects. 

To fight social desirability bias, keep these pro-tips in mind: 

- **Conduct 1:1 interviews.** Social desirability bias is more likely to occur in group settings, where a participant might respond in a way that they think will be viewed favorably by other research participants. Conducting interviews individually allows for more points of view to emerge because participants are more likely to share their authentic opinions. 
- **Ensure confidentiality.** Before beginning a research study, remind participants that their perspectives about the product will be kept confidential. For example, it can put people’s minds at ease to know that their name will not be published or their negative feedback will not become public. 

The **Hawthorne effect** describes how people tend to act differently when they know they’re being watched. People often work harder or perform better when they know they are participants in a research study or experiment. If you watch documentaries or reality TV, you know that everything changes when the camera is on! In the case of research, telling participants that the interview will be recorded or that stakeholders are watching from behind a mirror will influence the participants’ behavior in an undesired way.

Try these pro-tips to avoid the Hawthorne effect in your research: 

- **Create a non-threatening environment.** Let participants know that there are no right or wrong answers, and allow them time to feel comfortable in the research environment before diving into interview questions. 
- **Establish rapport.** It’s easier for participants to share their honest opinions when they feel at ease with the interviewer. Use the participant's name throughout the conversation to make the experience feel more personal, and make small talk before the research study begins. 

As you set out into the world as an up-and-coming UX designer, remember that taking deliberate steps to overcome biases will make your research findings more accurate and actionable. After all, if you want to design a product that really helps users, you need to know their honest perspectives.
