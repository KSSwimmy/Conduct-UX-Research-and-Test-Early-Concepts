A **usability study** is a research method that assesses how easy it is for users to complete core tasks in a design.

In a UX context, a **research study** is a step-by-step examination of a group of users and their needs, which adds realistic context to the design process.

**Project stakeholders** are people who are involved in the project or who will be impacted by its results.

### Reading: Language and communication in UX research

As a UX designer, you’ll regularly communicate and collaborate with others, especially while doing research. One of the most essential aspects of conducting research is understanding how to communicate effectively with all different kinds of people. In this reading, you’ll explore the distinct roles that language and communication play in UX research. 

#### Language and communication matter

When it comes to UX research, written and spoken language play a very important role in the success of your product and the feedback you receive about your designs. Language is the primary tool you’ll use for collecting data, building relationships with research study participants, reporting research findings to your team, and representing the users you’re designing for.  

The language you use while conducting research directly affects the language your participants use. For example, if you use a formal speaking style, participants might feel less comfortable being open and honest, and they might respond in a more formal style themselves. Using language that’s appropriate for the context can help you get a deeper understanding of participants’ unique perspectives and values. Every word you use when asking questions, taking notes, or transcribing quotes needs to accurately represent the ideas that participants convey. 

Your understanding of the best language to use in any given situation will continually shift as you learn the ins and outs of conducting UX research. Using appropriate language while conducting research is an ongoing process!

#### Consider word choices 
When conducting research, it’s important that you understand your own ideas on language use, as well as the ideas other communities have about language. This way, you can better identify and avoid your own biases about language use. All languages are important and complex, and they deserve to be represented equally. 

Keep in mind that some languages and language varieties express the same concepts in different ways. For example, in Standard American English, potato chips are a popular savory snack, while in British English, the same snack is known as crisps. Similarly, African American English, Creole, and other dialects have their own unique words, pronunciations, and expressions. If you’re not certain what a research study participant meant by something they said, ask them! If that’s not possible, talk to colleagues or outside experts to learn about what the participant might have intended. As the UX designer conducting research, it’s your responsibility to seek clarification on language differences and to ensure the translations of participants’ insights are accurate. 

There’s no right or wrong way to communicate an idea, but language often reveals hidden power imbalances. When conducting research, you want to make sure you’re communicating in a way that’s inviting, not commanding. For example, avoid using words that are considered **ableist**, or words that assume a person does not have a disability. You can imagine that a researcher might say to a participant, “Let’s walk through the details of the study.” Instead, it’s just as easy to say, “Let’s go through the details of the study.” That second phrase doesn’t make any assumptions, intended or not, about a person’s physical capabilities. 

Overall, your goal when conducting research is to make participants feel welcomed and valued for who they are. It takes time to change language and word choice habits, so don’t get discouraged if you make a mistake. Being aware of the words you use is an important step in being inclusive.

#### Keep the context in mind
You also need to consider the context that the research is happening in, such as the physical space where the research study is taking place. You want participants to feel like there’s an equal power dynamic between them and you as the researcher. For example, if one person is sitting and the other person is standing, there’s an unequal power dynamic and the situation can feel awkward or off putting. 

Some portions of your research studies might need to be adjusted to meet participants where they are. Different communities have different ways of interacting with others in various situations, so it’s important to be aware of those cultural differences. For example, some cultural groups take turns when speaking, while others feel free to interrupt whenever they have a great idea. In other words, one research study participant might consider interrupting to be rude, while another might think that interrupting shows engagement in the conversation. In your role as a researcher, you need to be aware of context changes and pay close attention to how participants prefer to communicate to create an equitable environment for all participants.

With these considerations in mind, you'll be set up for success when conducting research with participants and collecting feedback about your designs. Remember, language and communication are an art that can take years to master — and you're just getting started!

### Get to know the seven elements of a research plan

- **Project Background** - The project background answers the question: What led you to conduct this research? You don't have to provide a long drawn out history, just a few lines is good.

You might explain the project background like this: We're creating a new app to help people find and schedule dog walkers. We need to find out if the main user experience, finding and scheduling a dog walker, is easy for users to complete.

- **Research Goals** - Next, your plan should include research goals. 

Ask yourself questions like, What design problems are you trying to solve? And how will the results of the research impact our design decisions? Use your answers to create goals for your research project. 

- **Research Questions** - What are the questions your research is trying to answer? For example, our research questions might be, how long does it take a user to find and book a dog walker in the app? 

And what can we learn from the user flow or the steps that users take to book a dog walker?


- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** - Another important element of your plan is the key performance indicators, or KPIs. As a reminder, key performance indicators are critical measures of progress toward an end goal. 

You might ask, how can you measure your progress toward the research goal? For our app, one thing we should track is how many users in the research study complete their search for a dog walker. So the KPI would be the percentage of users who book a dog walker.


- **Methodology** - This is where you document the steps you'll take to conduct your research. How will you collect data and how will you analyze the data once you get it? 

To find out if users are able to find and schedule a dog walker in our new app, we might want to conduct a survey of prospective users. To analyze the survey results, we will use a spreadsheet and identify trends.  

- **Participants** - In addition, your research plan lists the research participants. Who will you survey? What characteristics do the participants have? For example, you might want to recruit participants who are dog owners with full-time jobs and who go out for activities more than once a week. 

The types of participants you select should be based on your research goals. Also, make sure that participants you select do not bias your results.

- **Script** -  The final step in your research plan is to script the questions you ask study participants as they test your product. 

The script is also known as the discussion guide. Make sure these questions are specific in speaking to the KPIs you're trying to measure. For instance, you could ask, did you face any challenges when trying to book a dog walker in the app?

### Start building a research plan: project background, research goals, and research questions

##### How to write the project background 

- identify the signals that indicated reseach was necessary 
- Describe any previous research 
- List insights the research will generate

**Insight** - An insight is an observation about people that helps you understand the user or their needs from a new perspective.

**Foundational research goal** - Understand why or if you should build the product

**Post-launch research goal** - Understand if the product worked as expected

**Research questions** provide focus and structure for your research study. They will be the main topics in a presentation. 

##### How to write research questions: 

- Actionable 
- Specific 
- Avoid leading questions 

**Quantitative research** - Focuses on data that can be gather by counting or measuring 

**Qualitative research** - focuses on observations about why and how things happen -- think written descriptions. 

Quantitative research focuses on data that can be gathered by counting or measuring -- think numbers. 

Qualitative research focuses on observations about why and how things happen -- think written descriptions. 

Let's revisit the example from our dog walking app. The first research question -- On average, how many times a week does a user hire a dog walker through the app? -- will give you quantitative numerical data. 

The second research question -- What frustrated users most about finding a dog walker through the app? -- will give you qualitative information.

### Activity Exemplar: Start building your research plan: project background, research goals, and research questions

With a well-crafted introduction and primary research questions, your UX research study plan will have a strong base you can use to build the rest of your plan. The introduction and primary research questions will help your design team:

- Establish research goals
- Identify who’s affected by the design
- Define research deliverables 
- Ensure research data quality

Here is a completed exemplar along with an explanation of how the exemplar fulfills the expectations for the previous activity. 

This is an exemplar using the CoffeeHouse scenario you have been following in this and other courses. The example includes a UX research study plan introduction and primary research questions. The other parts of the research plan will be completed in a future activity.

In this exemplar, the UX research study plan clearly identifies each key element of a plan introduction:

- **Title:** The focus and reason for the study.
- **Author:** Researcher’s name, title, and email address.  
- **Stakeholders:** Group targeted for testing, and the names and titles of key people at the company who oversee app changes and operations. 
- **Date:** When the plan was last updated. 
- **Project background:** A brief explanation of why the CoffeeHouse app is being updated and what is being tested with users.
- **Research goals:** What we’d like to learn from testing the CoffeeHouse app update, and how our research results might affect our design decisions.

With the introduction details clearly defined, the primary research questions could be written based on those details. The questions are:

- Actionable. The question answers will enable the researchers to provide actionable feedback to the design team.
- Specific instead of broad, and can produce meaningful data.
- Neutrally phrased and not leading. None of the questions favor one specific answer choice. 
- Express whether the research method should be quantitative or qualitative. one question is quantitative and can be measured. One question is qualitative, and offers opportunities to learn users’ feelings and other insights about the app update that are hard to measure.

Now compare the exemplar above to your completed deliverable. Assess what you’ve done using each of the criteria used here to evaluate the exemplar. 

Have you constructed a UX research study plan introduction that:

- Has a **title** that represents the focus and reason for the study?
- Lists the name, title, and email address for the **author** of the plan?  
- Identifies the study’s **stakeholders**, including any groups targeted for testing and people at the company whose work might be affected by the study? 
- Has the **date** that the plan was last updated?
- Includes a brief explanation of the **project background** that communicates the reason for the study and what is being tested?
- Outlines research goals that demonstrate what you’d like to learn from the study, and how your research results might affect your design decisions?

From your problem statement were you able to formulate corresponding primary research questions that are:

- Actionable and can clearly be answered by your research? 
- Specific to make sure your study produces meaningful data?
- Neutrally phrased and not leading, so users aren’t guided towards providing certain answers?
- Clear on whether quantitative or qualitative data is being collected?

If you’re able to answer “yes” to each of these questions — terrific job! If there are questions you were unable to answer “yes” to, then these are areas where you can improve your UX research study plan and primary research questions. Go back and rewrite those elements with these criteria in mind.

### Continue building a research plan: KPIs

**Key performance indicators**- These are critical measures of progress toward an end goal.

**Time on Task**- This measures how long it takes for a user to complete a task.


**Use of Navigation vs. search**- This KPI indicates the number of people who use a website or app's navigation compared to the number of people who use the search functionality.

**User error rates**- The third KPI, user error rates, indicate the parts of a design that cause users to make errors.

**Drop-off rates**- The fourth KPI to keep in mind is drop-off rates, which show how many users abandon the experience.

**Conversion rates**- On the other hand, a conversion rate is a number you want to see increase.

**System Usability Scale (SUS)**- A system usability scale, or SUS, is a questionnaire to measure the usability of your designs.

Key performance indicators 

- Time on task 
- Use of Navigation vs. search
- User error rates 
- Drop-off rates
- Conversion rates
- System Usability Scale (SUS)
